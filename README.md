## Possible Stackholders

1. Marvel & Dc: Taking the liscence rights.
2. Disney & Warner Bros: Funding the game.
3. End Users: Trying the game in the beta version to test it.

## Near Vision For The First 2 Sprints

1. 1st Sprint: Modeling a simple game enviroment and a simple charachter.
2. 2nd Sprint: Developing a simple game mechanics and animation for the character. 


## The Story Point Convention

I used the fibbonaci scale numbers in the convention, which are 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 80, 100. 
The epic point estimaation will be 100.


## Orderign The Product Backlog Items And The Rationale

The order of the items was created in order of the priority and functionality. The first step was making the game story, and then start making the shape of the game like the enviroments and characters, and finally animating and making the movement of the shapes created and testing it to see if the movement is correct.

1. Game Script
2. Game Logo
3. Character Design
4. Charachter Modeling
5. Enviroment Building
6. Texture & Lighting
7. Character Rigging
8. Characteer Animation
9. Developing Character Mechanics
10. Mechanics Testing


## Estimating How Many Story Points Can My Team Achieve Per Sprint

The 1st sprint is estimated to achieve 45 story points.
The 2nd sprint is estimated to achieve 60 story points. 
These will be achievable for a 4-weeks sprint.
